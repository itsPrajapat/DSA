// Bellman ford algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the shortest distance from the single vertex to all the other vertices of a weighted graph. There are various other algorithms used to find the shortest path like Dijkstra algorithm, etc. If the weighted graph contains the negative weight values, then the Dijkstra algorithm does not confirm whether it produces the correct answer or not. In contrast to Dijkstra algorithm, bellman ford algorithm guarantees the correct answer even if the weighted graph contains the negative weight values.
