// Heap :  Heap is a specialised tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property 
// 1. Min Heap
// 2. Max Heap
// A Complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.

// For 0-based indexing
// left child = 2*i + 1
// right child = 2*i + 2
// parent = (i+1)/2

// For 1-based indexing
// left child = 2*i
// right child = 2*i + 1
// parent = i/2;
